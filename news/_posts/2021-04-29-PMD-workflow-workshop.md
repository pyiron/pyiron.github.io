title: PMD onboarding workshop: pyiron workflow environment (video tutorial)
---  
In the frame of Platform material digital (PMD), on 29th of April 2021, an onboarding workshop on workflow environments was organized for the members of the platform. In the workshop, Dr. Muhammad Hassani from MPIE, presented about pyiron workflows in a hands-on session. The video of this session is available on youtubre via [link](https://youtu.be/xNkzZx5Be8c).  
In the video, the generic features of pyiron on handling typical material science workflows are demonstrated. It is also shown how one can integrate new python/non-python simulation/analysis tools into pyiron as new job classes. Moreover, a workflow example of combining atomistics and continuum-scale simulations (using LAMMPS and DAMASK) in a single pyiron project has been discussed.   
The notebooks presented in the video can be accessed via https://github.com/materialdigital/PMD-workflow-workshop.
