We are happy to announce our next virtual workshop on ["Workflows for atomistic simulation" from 10th to 12th of March 2021](http://potentials.rub.de): 
The workshop is focused on fitting interatomic potentials including classical pair-potentials, EAM-potentials as well as modern machine learning potentials. 
Interested participants can register on [potentials.rub.de](http://potentials.rub.de). The workshop is limited to a maximum of 80 participants.
