title: Tutorial at Los Alamos National Laboratory
---
As part of his yearly visits to [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov) [Jan Janssen](http://www.jan-janssen.com/) 
gave a tutorial on the new functionality added to the pyiron workflow framework. The tutorial covered the introduction 
to the pyiron job classes on the example of the [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/) simulation code, followed by the 
map-reduced based analysis of a large number simulation using the pyiron table class and finally the implementation of 
new pyiron job classes. In the last part particularly highlighted the recently introduced job decorator which simplifies
the conversion of Python functions to pyiron jobs.  

The material for the workshop is available in the [Github repository](https://github.com/pyiron-workshop/lammps-workshop-2023) 
and as [Jupyter book](http://workshop.pyiron.org/lammps-workshop-2023).
