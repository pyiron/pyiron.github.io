---
We are happy to announce that the [pyiron paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.07.043) was already cited over 
100 times after a bit more than five years. This highlights the impact of the pyiron framework for the computational 
materials science community and beyond as a general workflow manager. In addition, the pyiron conda-forge package has by
now be [downloaded over 200 000 times](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyiron/) so we already look forward to all the 
great research projects which are still on-going and are published in future.
