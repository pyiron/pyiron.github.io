title: Workshop - Software Tools from Atomistics to Phase Diagrams 
---
[Workshop on Software Tools from Atomistics to Phase Diagrams - November 10 and 11, 2020 by Zoom](https://workshop.materialsgenomefoundation.org)
This workshop will give a detailed introduction to computational thermodynamic software based on atomistic simulations – pyiron – and the CALPHAD method – pycalphad and ESPEI. It will feature hands-on demonstrations and practical exercises that will enable attendees to perform atomistic calculations, develop CALPHAD databases with quantified uncertainty, and to propagate uncertainty to any thermodynamic calculation.
