title: Workshop - Workflows for Atomistic Simulation
---
While originally planned as an [international workshop](http://potentials.rub.de/) combining a series of talks from invited speakers with hands-on tutorials how to develop atomistic workflows in pyiron, the in-person workshop had to be cancelled due to the covid-19-pandemic. As a replacement we held a much smaller virtual workshop with a limited number of participants and only focused on the hands-on tutorials. The material of the workshop is available [online](https://pyiron.org/pyiron-virtual-workshop-2020/README.html).
