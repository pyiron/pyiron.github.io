title: pyiron 0.1.8 - opensource release
---
After [Jan Janssen](http://www.jan-janssen.com/) joined the department of [Joerg Neugebauer](https://www.mpie.de/person/43010/2763386) 
in May 2015 he quickly took the lead on the pyiron development. He extended the support for operating systems from just 
Windows to Linux and Mac, added Python 3.X support to the previously Python 2.7 based code and improved the job 
management. All these changes in combination with switching from the PyQT based interface to Jupyter Notebooks as the 
primary way how users interact with the software lead to the changing the name from pyCMW to pyiron which is a 
combination of python and iron given the name of the institute pyiron was originally developed the 
["Max-Planck-Insitut f√ºr Eisenforschung"](https://www.mpie.de/CM) which is iron research in German. pyiron was adopted 
within the [department of Joerg Neugebauer](https://www.mpie.de/CM) which lead to the decision to release it as 
opensource.
