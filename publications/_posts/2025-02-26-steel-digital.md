abstract: The innovative strength of the steel industry is based on the mastery of microstructure–property relationships. Digital workflows can largely contribute to this aim by making the complexity of workflows reproducible and their execution user independent. In this work, the tools and workflows developed in the project StahlDigital as part of the German MaterialDigital initiative are presented and application examples are provided. A steel ontology builds the foundation for data collection and storage as well as for the semantic description of experimental and simulation data processing workflows. A dataspace powered by the Dataspace Management System (DSMS) digitally represents such workflows and manages data along them in a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable manner aiming to derive new knowledge. Experimental data processed via DSMS can be further evaluated and used as input for simulation workflows. The simulations included in such workflows are run by the workflow system pyiron, which has been semantically extended in StahlDigital for this purpose.
