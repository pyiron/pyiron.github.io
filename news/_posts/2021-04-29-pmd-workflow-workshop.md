title: Workshop - MaterialDigital
---
In the frame of Platform material digital (PMD), on 29th of April 2021, an onboarding workshop on workflow environments 
was organized for the members of the platform. A series of pyiron workflows have been presented in the workshop by Dr. 
Muhammad Hassani from MPIE. The video of this hands-on session is available on YouTube via the [link](https://youtu.be/xNkzZx5Be8c).    
In the video, the generic features of pyiron on handling typical material science workflows are introduced. It is also 
shown how one can integrate new python/non-python simulation/analysis tools into pyiron.  
Moreover, in an exemplary workflow, the interfacing between a series of [LAMMPS](https://lammps.org) atomistics 
simulations and crystal plasticity simulations of [DAMASK](https://damask.mpie.de/) via a pyiron project is demonstrated. 
The workflow determines the macroscopic response of an Al-Mg alloy based on its atomistic properties.  
The notebooks presented in the video can be accessed via [materialdigital/PMD-workflow-workshop](https://github.com/materialdigital/PMD-workflow-workshop).
