abstract: Solute segregation in alloys is a key phenomenon which affects various material characteristics such as embrittlement, grain growth and precipitation kinetics. In this work, the segregation energies of Y, Zr, and Nb to a 5 grain boundary in a bcc Ti-25 at % Mo alloy are determined using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A systematic approach is laid out by computing the solution energy distributions in the bulk alloy using Warren-Cowley short-range order parameters to find a representative bulk-solute reference energy. Additionally, different scenarios are considered when a solute atom replaces different sites in terms of their local Ti-Mo chemistry at the GB plane to calculate the distribution of segregation energies. The solute segregation to a Mo site at the GB plane is preferred rather than to a Ti site. Further analysis shows that these segregation energy trends can be rationalized based on a primarily elastic interaction. Thus the segregation energies scale with the solute size such that Y has the largest segregation energies followed by Zr and Nb.
