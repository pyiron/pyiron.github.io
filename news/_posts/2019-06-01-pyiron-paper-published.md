We are happy to announce the publication of the [pyiron paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.07.043) in the 
journal of computational materials science. The paper covers the features of pyiron 0.1.X, discusses the motivation to 
represent the whole simulation lifecycle with one software and was written by the pyiron developers at the 
["Max-Planck-Insitut f√ºr Eisenforschung"](https://www.mpie.de/CM) in collaboration with the pyiron developers at 
["Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Materials Simulation (ICAMS)"](http://www.icams.de/content/departments/atomistic-modelling-and-simulation/). 
In addition the pyiron objects which connect the jupyter based user interface, the data storage and computing resources 
are introduced and their application in the development of complex simulation protocols is illustrated by three hands-on
examples. We hope the pyiron paper is educational for new users to understand the philosophy which drives the 
development of pyiron, mainly simplify complex simulation protocols by separating scientific complexity and technical 
complexity.
