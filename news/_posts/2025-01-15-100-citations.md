title: The pyiron paper was cited 100 times
---
We are happy to announce that the [pyiron paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.07.043) was already cited over 
100 times after a bit more than five years. This highlights the impact of the pyiron framework for the computational 
materials science community and beyond as a general workflow manager. A summary of the different pyiron usecases with the 
corresponding publications is available on [Github](https://github.com/pyiron/.github/blob/main/profile/publication.md). 
In addition, the pyiron conda-forge package has by now be [downloaded over 200 000 times](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyiron/) 
so we already look forward to all the great research projects which are still on-going and are published in future.
