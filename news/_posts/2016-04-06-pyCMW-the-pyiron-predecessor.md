title: pyCMW - the pyiron predecessor
---
After long discussions on how to improve the transferability and reproducibility of complex simulation protocols, the 
predecessor of pyiron - pyCMW was born in 2011. pyCMW stands for python based computational material science workbench 
and was originally an airport project of [Joerg Neugebauer](https://www.mpie.de/person/43010/2763386), meaning he worked
on it when ever he was stuck at an airport. It combines a PyQT based file browser and code editor, HDF5 based data 
storage and a PostgreSQL database to index the individual calculations. Given the time constraints pyCMW was a prototype 
for a long time until Ugur Aydin joined the development. He was the first PhD student to apply pyCMW to study 
["Interstitial solution enthalpies derived from first-principles"](https://digital.ub.uni-paderborn.de/hsx/content/titleinfo/1982843). 
We congratulate him to the successful defence of his thesis and wish him all the best for his future career.
