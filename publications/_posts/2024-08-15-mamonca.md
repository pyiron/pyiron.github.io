abstract: Magnetic interactions account for a significant portion of free energy in certain materials, ranging from relatively simple systems such as iron to complex magneto-caloric effects of Heusler alloys (Weiss & Piccard, 1917). More specifically, in the case of iron, the ground state would be wrongly predicted without considering magnetic interactions (Friák et al., 2001). In Heusler systems, the understanding of magnetic properties could allow for the development of highly efficient refrigeration systems. In materials science, the Heisenberg model is frequently employed to heuristically compute the magnetic part of the potential energy. There are two main methods to make use of the Heisenberg model at finite temperature one is the Monte Carlo method for an efficient free energy minimization, the other is spin dynamics for the calculation of spin configuration evolution. The Monte Carlo method has the advantage of obtaining the free energy rapidly, while spin dynamics also delivers the kinetics of the system. mamonca allows for the evaluation of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with extended terms using both Monte Carlo method and spin dynamics.
